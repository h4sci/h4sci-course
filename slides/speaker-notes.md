# Block 1 Session 1: The Big Picture

## Title Slide

Hi, I am Matt. I am a software architect / developer / data engineer / retired
economist. I've been programming for 20+ and I am trying to teach the tricks I 
thought I knew when I started my PhD and now know that didn't just wish that I did. 
Does that make sense? 

I'll say a bit more about the course later and 
also give everyone the opportunity to say hi. For I'll just give an outline for today:
