## Overall Course Outline

<!-- 
Why git first? Cause reading other people's code is very good input
and github is the largest resource of open source code. 

git seems to be the common denominator useful for everyone in 
a quite heterogeneous group...

## Automation

<!--
- APIs
- functions
-->


---

class: center,middle

## Data Visualization

<!--

- d3
- coolest visualizations
- argument againts tableau (decent viz, but niche, programming can be used more flexible)
-->


---

## Code as a Communication Channel

<!--
- reproducible research
- github

## Introduction to Version Control with git

class: center, middle

## Why learn git? 

<!-- 
- used waaaaayyyy beyond academia (MS paid 7 billion for GitHub)
- de facto standard for collaboration, proven workflows
=> fits you right in. makes you a team player. Willing to dig into some overhead
for the sake of smooth sailing for everybody -> strong signal on the job market. 
Personally I don't care to much about languages, you'd eventually learn them,
but if you don't know git by now, it says something about your willingness.

## Git's + / -

## Git Basic Functionality

<!-- 

slides from h4n schema

-->

---

## Use the Console, Luke! 

basics
- git init
- git status
- git log
- git add <filename>
- git commit -m 'what changes were about'
- git push origin <branch name>
- git pull

going back


branches
- git branch
- git checkout <filename>
- git checkout <branch name>
- git merge <some-branch> 

--- 

## Follow Along

- show stuff using R Studio server's terminal (sent students pws through e-doz)
- create a folder called playground
- cd into it
- run git init to create a repo
- git add
- git commit -m 'message!'
- git log
- git status
 
---


## Git Teamwork: Remote Repository... 

- connect using an RSA Key
- students need to register at GitHub for the course
- create repository called 'sandbox'
- create a file named <your_lastname> and say Hi to the world. (demonstrate ff)

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

- edit the file called README.md, add, commit push your change
- merge conflict that needs a resolution. Order names, firstnames, age in the 
same file. resolve conflicts. quit vim.

## Programming with Data

## Data Formats

- cross section
- time series
- panel

## File Formats

## Beyond File Based Storage: Database SQL vs NoSQL

## Data Management When to Do What

Case study: file based vs. PostgreSQL

- file based storage
- PostgreSQL

Why have decades of software engineering not found an inevitable format? 
Cause there are different needs. Luckily, we can transform data. This is what
programming /w data is mostly about. 


## Licenses & Open Data


## Consuming data

- KOF Datenservice API + kofdata API wrapper for R 
- well documented projects gtrendecon
- OK'ish .csvs
- FSO spreadsheets






class: prod

## What is Production?

## Docker in One Slide

- Single purpose, application focused virtualization

- Images are blueprints for containers

- Images live in registries such as dockerhub.com

- Docker files are text based configs from which images are created

- Images can be stacked, so we can build on existing images. 

---

class: dockers

## Main Components: Docker Containers  

.pull-left[

permanent containers: 

- PostgreSQL
- Apache Airflow
- miniCRAN
- custom docker registry
- APIs (plumber, servr, express.io)

non-permanent containers

- a universal base image
- task specific images

]


---

## Main Components: Gitlab CI

.pull-left[


on push to default branch

- build (R) packages 
- push to miniCRAN
- deploy to servers
- push files to docker host / volumes (rsync)
- (rebuild docker images)

]

## The Role of R 

.pull-left[

### What Does R Do in This?

- miniCRAN + R packages take care of dependencies
- Downloading, reading and processing data using packages such as
_{readxl}_, _{httr}_, _{rvest}_, _{xml2}_, _{jsonlite}_,
_{pxR}_, _{tsbox}_, _{yaml}_, ... 
- R is used as database interface layer _{timeseriesdb}_

- R is inclusive: it's interpreted. It runs on any major OS. Amazing resources 
to reach carpentry level. It's free.
