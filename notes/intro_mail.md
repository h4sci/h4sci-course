Dear all, 

Thank you for enrolling to Hacking for Social Sciences. I am very much looking forward 
to the start of the course at the beginning of October. Let's work together to make the course
a great experience, all of you can benefit from for your (doctoral) studies – no matter the discipline and 
starting background. 

In order to get at least some of the work onboarding and configuration work out of the way, I would like to 
ask you to install the following software in advance 

- The R Language for Statistical Computing
- Git Version Control (Windows users please also install git bash)

We will also use an ETH hosted R Studio Server during the course, so in case you can't get the above done with a reasonable amount of effort, you will be covered.  
Both of the above software is installed on the server and you won't need anything beyond a browser to work with it. Yet, it's an advantage to have a local installation on your computer 
for performance reasons and the fact that you can go on to use the software beyond this course. 

Also please sign up for a free GitHub account. The course will use multiple formats to stay interactive despite being online:  

- There will be live sessions using zoom on all course days. 
- We will have quizzes and tasks to work on individually and in groups
- all materials (except for recordings with students on them) will be available as (pre) recorded videos. 

In addition to the course days there will be a Slack Channel for support and exchange that is open the entire semester (and hopefully beyond).
Note that being on Slack is not manadatory it's just an additional offer to foster exchange among students and be able to ask support questions. 
Through the async nature of Slack chat, we will have an additional 
channel for lively discussion. Feel free to join:  also in advance of the course. 
This course is about you. If you face technological challenges during your studies, bring them to the course. It's better to discuss real world problems than 
the best cooked up examples! 

If you have any questions or do not like Slack you can always send an e-mail to bannert@kof.ethz.ch . 

best

Matt
