## Task 1: Get Familiar with Git (local repository functions)

After getting a rough idea of the Big Picture of Programming with Data's toolbox, the goal of the first task is to make you familiar with the 101 of git version control. Make sure to complete all of the following. 

- [ ]  turn a folder on your disk into a git repository. add a text file to it, edit, add and commit the changes. 
- [ ]  add more files and/or make more changes to your newly created repository and commit them. 
- [ ]  use the log, pick a commit and go back to this commit. Come up with an explanation (that you could bring to class) of the *detached HEAD state* and evaluate why it's implemented that way. Think of going back to a few commits and then going back again to where you have been before. 
- [ ] describe your first git version control experience. (If you were familiar with git, give us your take on git, too ;) )

Please do not check the boxes above individually. We will do so as a class. Please put the your answer in the comments below for now. We will turn to submitting answers in files later on (let's make sure first everybody is on the same page). 


## Task 2: First Collaborative Git Steps

- [ ] Clone this repository to your local disk or R Studio Server
- [ ] Create a markdown file called `task-2-your-name.md` that holds your name. Please avoid spaces and/or special characters, use lowercase only. Doing so helps avoid encoding problems we might encounter with different locales, different operating systems etc. 
- [ ] Briefly introduce yourself in the file and say why you took this, course what you expect from it. 
- [ ] Are there any examples tasks in research you hope to get help with, describe them if applicable. Maybe we can cover them in class or turn them into your semester project! Add this to the file that bears your name. 
- [ ] Add, commit and push the file to the repository. Make sure to pull before you push! 
- [ ] Describe your experience in the comments below. Where there any conflicts? If yes, how could they be resolved? 


## Task 3: Merge Conflict Drill

Though good co-ordination  (mostly simply not editing the same files at the same time) avoids merge conflicts that can't be solved automatically in practice. Especially on smaller teams such conflicts are rare but one should know how to handle them. 
Hence, in this task, let's create a merge conflict. 

- [ ] create file named `task-3-name-of-your-group.md` (change the placeholder with the whatever group from Aces to Eights you have been assigned to) 

- [ ] add your name to that file: add, commit, pull push. Depending on who was the first in your group to push. You will have get merge conflict. Which version is the right one? Are all versions to be kept. Work together to remove the conflict and push the result. 

The goal in the end is to have file for each group that contains its members name like this: 

- Donald Duck
- Bugs Bunny
- Superman
- Batman
- Globi
