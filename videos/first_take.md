Ait, welcome everybody. My name is Matt and I am excited to do the first ever clip of Hacking for Social Sciences. As you can see I am not in a Manhattan Recording Studio. Rather my own basement. Seems about right for a Hacking course. Still quite a bit of daylight coming in but I might be able to fix that over time. 

This series of short video is accompanied by quite some material such as slides, code over on GitHub and a free online book. Check out the description of the video below to make sure you don't miss these materials. Also, if you have any questions or suggestions. Leave them in the comments below. 

For a first clip in a wide field the questions is always where is the starting point. But in this case it was simple: If you take only one thing away from Hacking for Social Sciences it should be -how to version control- . For me learning git version control was the door to a much bigger world.
