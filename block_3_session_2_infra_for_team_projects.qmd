# Introduction to GitHub Pages 


## Github Pages in a Nutshell

- every github repository can opt to have a repository specific website
- GitHub Pages is designed to document and/or market the software developed in the repo
the URL pattern is: user.github.io/repository-name
- GitHub Pages sites either reside on a separate gh-pages branch or in the docs folder on the main branch.
- GitHub Pages can be activated through the Github GUI
- GitHub Pages can host either .md files or .html webpages (including .js and .css)

Examples: devops-carpentry.github.io/book, mbannert.github.io/timeseriesdb
